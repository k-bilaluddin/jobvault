> An AI-powered, event-driven job application pipeline — automating CV tailoring, cover letter generation, and application tracking.

**Live:** [API](https://api.kbilaluddin.dev/swagger/index.html) · [Frontend](https://jobvault.kbilaluddin.dev)

> **⚠️ Project Status: Prototype**
> JobVault is an actively evolving prototype. I'm continuously upgrading it and shipping new features — both to make my own job application workflow easier and as a deliberate vehicle to upskill on production-grade tooling (RabbitMQ, Vue.js, Docker, CI/CD, cloud infrastructure).

## What It Does

JobVault automates the entire job application workflow:

1. **Paste a job URL into Claude** — AI extracts the job description and generates tailored CV and cover letter files
2. **Claude pushes files to GitHub** — application documents land in a dedicated vault repo
3. **Webhook triggers** — JobVault API receives the push event and ingests data into MongoDB
4. **RabbitMQ fires events** — application events are published to queues for async processing
5. **Telegram notification** — JobVaultBot sends an instant mobile alert with application details
6. **Track everything in the UI** — review, manage, and follow up on every application from one dashboard

---

## Frontend (Vue 3)

The web UI is the command centre for all applications:

- **Overview dashboard** — see all applications at a glance: status, company, role, and key dates
- **Direct apply** — jump straight from an application card to the original job posting and apply from there
- **Application history** — full timeline of every application, including generated documents and status changes
- **Follow-up notifications** — get reminded when it's time to follow up on an application, so nothing falls through the cracks

## Why I Built This

I'm a Senior Full Stack Developer job hunting in Germany. Managing dozens of tailored applications across multiple platforms was becoming a full-time job in itself. Instead of using a spreadsheet, I built JobVault — a system that automates the boring parts while giving me a live portfolio piece that demonstrates real production skills: Clean Architecture, event-driven design, Docker, CI/CD, and cloud infrastructure.

The secondary goal was deliberate upskilling: RabbitMQ depth, Vue.js, Docker, and Cloudflare Tunnel — all things I wanted production experience with, not just tutorials.

## Local Development

### Prerequisites

- [.NET 9 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)
- [Node.js 20+](https://nodejs.org/)
- MongoDB Atlas account
- CloudAMQP account (free tier works)
- Telegram Bot token

### 1. Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/k-bilaluddin/jobvault.git
cd jobvault
```

### 2. Configure environment variables

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Fill in your values
```

### 3. Run with Docker Compose

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

This starts:
- `jobvault-api` → http://localhost:5000/swagger
- `jobvault-worker` → background service

### 4. Run API locally (without Docker)

```bash
cd backend/src/JobVault.API
dotnet restore
dotnet run
```

### 5. Run frontend locally

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```
